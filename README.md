# Wishes


Wishes is an application to store your wishlist of things you want to do in future.

### Tech

Wishes uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


* [Spring Boot] - A Java Framework
* [Amazon Corretto] - Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK).
* [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition] - IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment written in Java for developing computer software.
* [Bootstrap 5] - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development


Wishes itself is open source with a [public repository] on GitHub.

### Usage

Clone the repository and open using an IDE (IntelliJ recommended).

Make sure all the dependencies are installed and run the server.

Navigate to localhost (127.0.0.1) using a web browser on the same device you are using to run the server.

```sh
localhost:8080/
```
